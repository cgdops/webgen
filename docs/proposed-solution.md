# Proposed Solution Overview
I want to create an app that makes it easy for users to connect their linkedin profile and use that as a source of truth to create a simple website for them. 

## Key Features
- Zero code website generation
- Mobile-first design
- Performance optimized code
- A11y principles built-in from the start
- No content brainstorming or copywriting needed
- Connect your linkedin account as a source of truth for your initial website
- Publish your website to github in one click

## Nice to have, but not needed for version 1 features
- If you are a founder, you can connect a company page to generate a company website that is already closely tied to your personal page.
